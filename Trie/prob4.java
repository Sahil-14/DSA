 * Find shortest unique prefix for every word in a given lis
 * Given an array of words, find all shortest unique prefixes to represent each
 * word in the given array. Assume that no word is prefix of another.
 * Examples:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: arr[] = {"zebra", "dog", "duck", "dove"}
 * Output: dog, dov, du, z
 * Explanation: dog => dog
 * dove => dov
 * duck => du
 * zebra => z
 * 
 * Input: arr[] = {"geeksgeeks", "geeksquiz", "geeksforgeeks"};
 * Output: geeksf, geeksg, geeksq}
 * 
 * 
 * An Efficient Solution is to use Trie. The idea is to maintain a count in
 * every node. Below are steps.
 * 1) Construct a Trie of all words. Also maintain frequency of every node (Here
 * frequency is number of times node is visited during insertion). Time
 * complexity of this step is O(N) where N is total number of characters in all
 * words.
 * 2) Now, for every word, we find the character nearest to the root with
 * frequency as 1. The prefix of the word is path from root to this character.
 * To do this, we can traverse Trie starting from root. For every node being
 * traversed, we check its frequency. If frequency is one, we print all
 * characters from root to this node and donâ€™t traverse down this node.
 * Time complexity if this step also is O(N) where N is total number of
 * characters in all words.
