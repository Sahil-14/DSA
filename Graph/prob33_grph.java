/**
 * 
 * Some explanation.
 * The key difference with the classic Dijkstra algo is, we don't maintain the
 * global optimal distance to each node, i.e. ignore below optimization:
 * alt ‚Üê dist[u] + length(u, v)
 * if alt < dist[v]:
 * Because there could be routes which their length is shorter but pass more
 * stops, and those routes don't necessarily constitute the best route in the
 * end. To deal with this, rather than maintain the optimal routes with 0..K
 * stops for each node, the solution simply put all possible routes into the
 * priority queue, so that all of them has a chance to be processed. IMO, this
 * is the most brilliant part.
 * And the solution simply returns the first qualified route, it's easy to prove
 * this must be the best route.
 * Complexity Analysis
 * Time Complexity: O(E+nlogn), where E is the total number of flights.?
 * Space Complexity: O(n), the size of the heap.?
 *
