*********    Stable vs Unstable Sorting Algorithm.    ********

If a sorting algorithm, after sorting the contents, does not change the sequence
 of similar content in which they appear, it is called stable sorting. else it is 
 unstable sorting .

 Stable sorting examples .
 1) Merge sort
 2) Bubble sort
 3) Count sort
 4) Insertion sort
 5) Time sort

 unStable sorting examples .
 1) Quick sort
 2) Selection sort
 3) Heap sort 


If order of the elements to be sorted of an input array matters (or) affects the time complexity of a sorting algorithm,
then that algorithm is called “Adaptive” sorting algorithm.

Adaptive sorting algorithms:
1. Bubble Sort
2. Insertion Sort
3. Quick Sort

Non-adaptive sorting algorithms:
1. Selection Sort
2. Merge Sort
3. Heap Sort
