// fractional knapsap
/**
 * The basic idea of the greedy approach is to calculate the ratio value/weight
 * for each item and sort the item on basis of this ratio. Then take the item
 * with the highest ratio and add them until we canâ€™t add the next item as a
 * whole and at the end add the next item as much as we can. Which will always
 * be the optimal solution to this problem. A simple code with our own
 * comparison function can be written as follows, please see sort function more
 * closely, the third argument to sort function is our comparison function which
 * sorts the item according to value/weight ratio in non-decreasing order. After
 * sorting we need to loop over these items and add them in our knapsack
 * satisfying above-mentioned criteria.
